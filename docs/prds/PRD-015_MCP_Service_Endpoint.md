# PRD-015: MCP Service Endpoint

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service endpoint. This endpoint will allow AI Coding Agents to interact with the AI Documentation Cache System to retrieve and cache documentation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. MCP Endpoint

- The system shall expose an HTTP endpoint compliant with the Model Context Protocol.
- The endpoint must handle MCP's `initialize`, `get_tools`, and `execute_tool` messages.

### 2.2. Tool Definition

- The service shall expose a tool named `fetch_documentation`.
- The tool will accept a single argument: `query` (string), which is the documentation topic to search for.

### 2.3. Core Logic (Cache-Aside Pattern)

1.  An `execute_tool` request is received for the `fetch_documentation` tool.
2.  The system checks AnythingLLM (the cache) for existing documentation matching the `query`.
3.  **Cache Hit**: If the documentation exists, it is retrieved from AnythingLLM and returned in the MCP response.
4.  **Cache Miss**: If the documentation does not exist:
    a. The system uses the integrated LLM to perform an intelligent search and retrieve the relevant documentation.
    b. The retrieved documentation is stored in AnythingLLM for future requests.
    c. The retrieved documentation is returned in the MCP response.

## 3. Technical Requirements

- The MCP endpoint shall be implemented using FastAPI.
- All interactions with AnythingLLM and the LLM provider must use the existing clients and services within the application.
- The implementation must adhere to the existing security, logging, and error handling standards.

## 4. Success Criteria

- An AI coding agent can successfully connect to the MCP endpoint.
- The agent can discover the `fetch_documentation` tool.
- Executing the tool with a query returns the correct documentation.
- On a cache miss, the system correctly fetches, stores, and returns the documentation.
- The endpoint is covered by integration tests.
