## Security Recommendations

### 1. Authentication Implementation
**CRITICAL**: The placeholder authentication must be replaced with proper JWT implementation before production deployment. Consider using:
- FastAPI's built-in OAuth2 with JWT tokens
- FastAPI Guard middleware for additional security layers

### 2. Container Security
- Add resource limits to all containers
- Use non-root users in containers
- Implement network policies

### 3. Secrets Management
- Replace default Grafana credentials (admin/admin)
- Use environment variables or secret management tools
- Never commit credentials to version control

### 4. API Security
- Enable CORS properly for production
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Add request validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS in production

### 5. Monitoring Security
- Restrict access to monitoring endpoints
- Use authentication for Prometheus and Loki APIs
- Implement audit logging for all access

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild all containers with updated dependencies
2. Test all functionality with new versions
3. Run security scans with tools like:
   - Bandit for Python code
   - Trivy for container images
   - OWASP ZAP for API testing

## Notes

- Promtail is deprecated and will enter LTS on Feb 13, 2025
- Consider migrating to Grafana Alloy for log collection
- All versions selected are stable releases with active support
