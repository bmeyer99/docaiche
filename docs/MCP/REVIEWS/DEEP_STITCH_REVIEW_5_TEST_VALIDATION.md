## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add Performance Regression Tests**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.performance
   @pytest.mark.benchmark
   def test_search_performance_regression(benchmark):
       result = benchmark(search_adapter.search, request)
       assert result.response_time < 100  # ms
   ```

2. **Implement Contract Testing**
   ```python
   def test_mcp_protocol_contract():
       # Validate against MCP 2025 specification
       assert validate_against_schema(request, MCP_SCHEMA)
   ```

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Chaos Engineering Tests**
   - Random failure injection
   - Network partition simulation
   - Resource exhaustion testing

2. **Enhance Load Testing**
   - Add Locust test scenarios
   - Implement sustained load tests
   - Add spike testing

### Low Priority
1. **Consider Mutation Testing**
   - Use mutmut or similar tools
   - Validate test effectiveness

2. **Add Visual Test Reports**
