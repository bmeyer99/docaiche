# Phase 3: Integration (System Assembly and Production Readiness)

## Phase Overview

**Duration**: Week 6-7  
**Objective**: Connect all components into cohesive, production-ready system with cross-cutting concerns  
**ASPT Focus**: Deep Stitch reviews after major integrations to validate architecture, performance, and operational readiness  
**Agent Focus**: System-level integration with comprehensive validation

## Context and Prerequisites

### What Was Built in Phase 2
- SearchOrchestrator with complete MCP workflow
- Text AI service with LLM integration
- External search providers (Brave, Google, DuckDuckGo)
- Configuration API with all 28 endpoints
- Admin UI with real-time updates

### What We're Integrating in Phase 3
Transform individual components into production-ready system:
- Complete MCP server integration
- FastAPI adapter for existing endpoints
- Cross-cutting security implementation
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Production deployment configuration

### Key Integration Principles
1. **System Coherence**: All components work together seamlessly
2. **Production Hardening**: Security, monitoring, and reliability
3. **Performance Validation**: Meet all performance requirements
4. **Operational Readiness**: Deployment, monitoring, maintenance
5. **Documentation Completeness**: Enable team adoption

## Task 3.1: MCP Server Integration

### Domain Focus
Cohesive MCP server implementation with complete component orchestration

### Objective
Integrate all Phase 2 components into a unified MCP server that implements the 2025 MCP specification with OAuth 2.1, Resource Indicators, and Streamable HTTP transport.

### Context from Previous Phases
- Phase 2 created all individual components
- Components need integration into MCP protocol
- Server must handle MCP tool invocations

### Implementation Requirements

#### MCP Server Core
Create the main MCP server that:
- Implements JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol handling
- Manages tool and resource registration
- Handles OAuth 2.1 authentication flows
- Supports Resource Indicators (RFC 8707)
- Implements Streamable HTTP transport
- Provides stdio fallback for compatibility

Server lifecycle management:
- Component initialization ordering
- Dependency injection setup
- Graceful startup sequence
- Health check endpoints
- Shutdown coordination

#### Tool Registration
Register all MCP tools with proper metadata:

**docaiche_search:**
- Query validation and sanitization
- Technology hint processing
- Scope parameter handling
- Result limiting enforcement
- Proper error responses

**docaiche_collections:**
- Workspace enumeration
- Metadata enrichment
- Access control filtering
- Caching for performance

**docaiche_ingest:**
- Consent verification
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Validation pipeline
- Queue integration
- Progress tracking

**docaiche_status:**
- Health aggregation
- Capability reporting
- Version information
- Performance metrics

**docaiche_feedback:**
- Feedback validation
- Analytics integration
- Quality tracking
- Learning triggers

#### Resource Implementation
Implement MCP resources:
- Documentation access patterns
- Metrics exposure endpoints
- Workspace resource handlers
- Proper pagination support
- Caching strategies

#### Transport Layer
Implement transport protocols:
- Streamable HTTP with chunking
- WebSocket upgrade support
- Long polling fallback
- Connection management
- Error recovery

#### Authentication Integration
Implement OAuth 2.1 flows:
- Authorization code flow
- Resource indicators support
- Token validation
- Scope enforcement
- Consent management

## Task 3.2: Client Adapter Integration

### Domain Focus
Adapter layer connecting MCP server with existing DocAIche APIs

### Objective
Create seamless integration between the new MCP implementation and existing FastAPI endpoints, maintaining backwards compatibility while enabling new functionality.

### Context from Previous Task
- MCP server provides new search capabilities
- Existing APIs need to leverage MCP functionality
- Backwards compatibility must be maintained

### Implementation Requirements

#### Adapter Architecture
Design adapter pattern that:
- Translates existing API calls to MCP tools
- Maintains existing response formats
- Handles authentication mapping
- Provides migration path
- Enables gradual adoption

#### API Compatibility Layer
Implement compatibility for:
- Existing search endpoints
- Workspace management APIs
- Configuration endpoints
- Analytics integration
- WebSocket connections

Translation requirements:
- Parameter mapping
- Response transformation
- Error code mapping
- Header preservation
- Context propagation

#### Authentication Bridge
Create authentication bridge that:
- Maps existing JWT to MCP tokens
- Handles scope translation
- Maintains session consistency
- Supports both auth methods
- Enables migration period

#### Data Transformation
Implement transformations for:
- Request format conversion
- Response format adaptation
- Pagination handling
- Error response mapping
- Metadata preservation

#### Performance Optimization
Ensure adapter efficiency:
- Minimal overhead introduction
- Connection pooling
- Request batching where applicable
- Caching for repeated transformations
- Async processing throughout

#### Migration Support
Provide migration features:
- Dual-mode operation
- Feature flags for rollout
- A/B testing support
- Rollback capabilities
- Migration metrics

### ASPT Deep Stitch Review Checkpoint

**Review Focus:** API compatibility, performance impact, migration safety  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  

#### Validation Checklist:
