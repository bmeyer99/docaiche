# Search Provider Configuration Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing configurable external search providers in the DocAIche MCP system. This feature will allow users to select and configure different search engines for retrieving documentation when AnythingLLM vector search is insufficient.

## Problem Statement

When vector search through AnythingLLM cannot find relevant documentation for a user query, the system needs to fall back to external search providers. Different organizations may have preferences for specific search engines based on:
- Privacy requirements
- Result quality for their domain
- API availability and cost
- Geographical restrictions

Currently, the system lacks a standardized way to configure and manage these external search providers.

## Requirements

### 1. Provider Registry

- Implement a configurable registry of search providers
- Support multiple provider types simultaneously
- Allow enabling/disabling providers without system restart
- Provide default configurations for common providers

### 2. Supported Providers

The system should support the following search providers at minimum:

| Provider | Type | Features |
|----------|------|----------|
| Brave Search | Commercial API | Privacy-focused, good developer documentation |
| Google Search | Commercial API | Comprehensive results, domain-specific search |
| Bing Search | Commercial API | Alternative commercial engine |
| DuckDuckGo | Commercial API | Privacy-focused alternative |
| SearXNG | Self-hosted | Open-source metasearch engine |
| Custom API | User-defined | For internal or specialized search services |

### 3. Provider Configuration

Each provider should support configuration of:

- API endpoints
- Authentication credentials
- Rate limits and quotas
- Request timeouts
- Result filtering options
- Geographic/language preferences
- Domain restrictions (to limit search to specific sites)

### 4. Provider Interface

Implement a common interface that all providers must implement:

```python
class SearchProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def search(query: str, options: Dict[str, Any]) -> SearchResults:
        """Execute search and return standardized results"""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def get_capabilities() -> ProviderCapabilities:
        """Return provider capabilities"""
        pass
```

### 5. Result Standardization

All provider results should be normalized to a common format:

```python
class SearchResult:
    url: str
    title: str
    snippet: str
    source_type: Literal["webpage", "pdf", "github", "documentation"]
    estimated_relevance: float
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### 6. Provider Selection Logic

Implement intelligent provider selection based on:

- Query characteristics (technical, general knowledge, etc.)
- Previous success rates for similar queries
- Provider availability and rate limits
- User/organization preferences

### 7. Fallback Mechanism

- Implement cascading fallback between providers
- If primary provider fails or returns insufficient results, try secondary providers
- Log failures and automatically adjust provider preferences

### 8. Management API

Provide API endpoints for:

- Listing available providers
- Getting/setting provider configurations
- Testing provider connectivity
- Viewing provider usage statistics

### 9. User Interface Integration

Add UI components to the admin interface for:

- Provider configuration
- API key management
- Provider testing
- Usage monitoring

### 10. Documentation Retrieval Strategy

For each provider, implement specialized retrieval logic:

- GitHub: Direct access to raw content when possible
- Documentation sites: Extract relevant sections only
- General websites: Extract main content, removing navigation/ads
- PDFs: Extract text from relevant pages/sections

## Implementation Plan

1. Create provider interface and base classes
2. Implement Brave Search provider as reference implementation
3. Add configuration storage in database
4. Implement provider registry with dynamic loading
5. Create management API endpoints
6. Develop admin UI components
7. Add remaining providers
8. Implement advanced content extraction
9. Add provider selection logic
10. Document API and configuration options

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be encrypted at rest
- Provider usage should be audited
- Rate limiting should be enforced
- Content from external sources should be sanitized
- User permission controls for provider configuration

## Performance Goals

- Provider addition/removal without service interruption
- < 50ms overhead for provider selection
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- Efficient caching of provider results
- Automatic optimization of provider selection based on performance history

## Research Questions

Further research is needed to determine:

1. Best practices for content extraction from different sources
2. Optimal fallback strategies between providers
3. Privacy implications of different provider choices
4. Cost estimation for commercial API usage
5. Techniques for query optimization per provider
6. Methods for evaluating and comparing provider result quality
