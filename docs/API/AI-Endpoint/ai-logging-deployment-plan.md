```

## Technical Architecture

### Components:
- **FastAPI** - Async API framework
- **Loki 3.5.0** - Log storage and querying
- **Redis** - Caching layer
- **NetworkX** - Graph analysis
- **WebSocket** - Real-time streaming
- **Pydantic** - Data validation

### Data Flow:
1. Services → Promtail → Loki (log collection)
2. API Request → AILogProcessor → Cache Check
3. Cache Miss → LokiClient → Query Execution
4. Results → Pattern Detection → Correlation Analysis
5. Response → Cache Storage → Client

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Mode-based LogQL generation
   - Selective field extraction
   - Time-based partitioning

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Recent data: 30s-5m TTL
   - Historical data: 1-2h TTL
   - Pattern-based invalidation

3. **Streaming Efficiency**
   - Connection pooling
   - Batch message delivery
   - Automatic dead connection cleanup

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication** - Integrated with existing auth
2. **Rate Limiting** - Per-endpoint limits
3. **Input Validation** - Pydantic models
4. **Query Restrictions** - Time range limits
5. **Cache Security** - No sensitive data in keys

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 3** - Production readiness
2. **Load Testing** - Verify performance at scale
3. **Documentation** - API guides and examples
4. **Training** - Team onboarding
5. **Monitoring** - Dashboard creation

## Conclusion

The AI Logging System is approximately 70% complete with all core functionality implemented. The remaining work focuses on production hardening, testing, and operational readiness. The system is already capable of providing comprehensive log analysis for AI agents with intelligent pattern detection and correlation capabilities.
