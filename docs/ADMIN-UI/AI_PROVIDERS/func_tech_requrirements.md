# AI Provider Configuration Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the functional and technical requirements for the AI Provider Configuration page, which allows users to configure and test AI providers and select models for text generation and embeddings.

## User Interface Components

### 1. Provider Selection Area
- Tabbed interface with three categories: Local, Cloud, and Enterprise
- List of available providers in each category with provider name and description
- Visual indicator for providers that have been tested (status badge)
- Selection mechanism to choose a provider for configuration

### 2. Provider Configuration Panel
- Dynamic configuration form based on the selected provider
- Required fields:
  - Base URL/API endpoint
  - Timeout settings (seconds)
  - Maximum retries
  - Any provider-specific fields (API keys, organization IDs, etc.)
- "Test Connection" button to validate the provider configuration

### 3. Model Selection Area
- Section for Text Generation model selection
- Section for Embeddings model selection
- Toggle switch to use the same provider for both text generation and embeddings
- Provider dropdown for each section (populated with tested providers only)
- Model dropdown for each section (populated based on selected provider)
- Warning notification when no providers are tested yet
- "Save Model Configuration" button

### 4. Current Configuration Display
- Shows the currently saved configuration
- Text Generation: Provider and model

- Visual indicator when configurations are synced

## Data Flow Requirements

### Initial Page Load
1. Frontend requests current configuration from backend API
2. Backend returns:
   - List of available providers by category
   - Provider test status for each provider
   - Current model configurations for text generation and embeddings
   - Available models for each tested provider
3. Frontend updates UI to reflect current state

### Provider Configuration and Testing
1. User selects a provider and fills in configuration details
2. User clicks "Test Connection" button
3. Frontend sends test request to backend with provider details
4. Backend:
   - Validates the configuration
   - Attempts to connect to the provider API
   - Runs a test query
   - Processes the response
   - Saves the configuration if successful
   - Returns test results and available models to frontend
5. Frontend:
   - Displays toast notification of success/failure
   - Updates provider status
   - Updates model selection dropdowns with available models
   - Updates current configuration display if applicable

### Model Selection and Saving
1. User selects models for text generation and/or embeddings
2. User clicks "Save Model Configuration" button
3. Frontend displays toast notification indicating saving in progress
4. Frontend sends model configuration to backend
5. Backend:
   - Saves the configuration in the database
   - Updates necessary services
   - Returns confirmation and updated configuration
6. Frontend:
   - Displays toast notification of success/failure
   - Updates current configuration display
   - Updates UI state

## API Requirements

### 1. Get Configuration API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/configuration`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: 
  - Available providers list
  - Provider test status
  - Current model configurations
  - Available models for tested providers

### 2. Test Provider API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/providers/test`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: Provider configuration
- **Response**: 
  - Test status (success/failure)
  - Error message (if failure)
  - Available models (if success)
  - Updated provider configuration (if success)

### 3. Save Provider Configuration API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/providers/config`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: Provider configuration
- **Response**:
  - Save status (success/failure)
  - Error message (if failure)
  - Updated provider configuration (if success)

### 4. Save Model Configuration API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/models/config`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: 
  - Text generation provider and model
  - Embeddings provider and model
- **Response**:
  - Save status (success/failure)
  - Error message (if failure)
  - Updated model configuration (if success)

## State Management Requirements

### Frontend State
- Provider categories and list
- Selected provider
- Provider configuration form values
- Provider test status
- Available models for each tested provider
- Selected models for text generation and embeddings
- "Use same provider" toggle state
- Current saved configuration
- Toast notifications state

### Backend State
- Provider configurations (stored in database)
- Model configurations (stored in database)
- Provider test results
- Available models per provider

## Error Handling Requirements

### Frontend Error Handling
- Form validation errors
- API communication errors
- Provider test failures
- Model save failures

### Backend Error Handling
- Invalid provider configuration
- Provider connection failures
- Database operation failures
- Service update failures

## Notification Requirements

### Toast Notifications
- Provider test initiated
- Provider test success/failure
- Model configuration save initiated
- Model configuration save success/failure
- Service update success/failure

## Performance Requirements
- Provider test operations should complete within 10 seconds or timeout
- Configuration save operations should complete within 5 seconds
- Page initial load should retrieve all necessary data in a single API call
- UI updates should be immediate upon state changes

## Security Requirements
- All API endpoints must be authenticated
- Provider credentials must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- User actions should be logged for audit purposes
- Configuration changes should be versioned

## Accessibility Requirements
- All form elements must have proper labels
- Error messages must be clear and descriptive
- Color indicators must have text alternatives
- Keyboard navigation must be fully supported

## Browser Compatibility
- Application must function in latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- State persistence must work consistently across all supported browsers
- UI layout must be responsive to different screen sizes

## Integration Requirements
- Backend must be able to communicate with all supported provider APIs
- Configuration changes must trigger appropriate service updates
- Text generation and embedding services must be updated when configurations change

## Logging Requirements
- All configuration changes must be logged
- Provider test operations must be logged
- Configuration save operations must be logged
- Service update operations must be logged
- Errors must be logged with detailed context

## Persistence Requirements
- All configurations must persist across page reloads
- All configurations must be stored in the backend database
- Service configurations must be updated when model configurations change

## Synchronization with Previous Process Flow

This requirements document aligns with the previously documented process flow in the following ways:

1. **Provider Testing Process**: 
   - Steps 1-8 of the process flow are implemented in the "Provider Configuration and Testing" section
   - Success/failure paths are clearly defined
   - Configuration saving is part of the test process

2. **Model Configuration Process**:
   - Steps 9-11 of the process flow are implemented in the "Model Selection and Saving" section
   - Toast notifications for operations are included
   - Service updates are triggered by configuration changes

3. **Page Reload Process**:
   - The "Initial Page Load" section implements the page reload process
   - State restoration is handled by the backend API
   - UI is updated to reflect current configuration

This document ensures that all the requirements specified in the process flow are addressed and provides additional details for implementation.
