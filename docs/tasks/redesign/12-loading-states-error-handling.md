# Task 12: Loading States & Error Handling Polish

## Overview
Polish and refine all loading states, error handling, and empty states throughout the configuration interface to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Reference Specification Sections
- Section 6.2: UI States & Loading Behavior
- Section 5.4: Toast Notification Implementation
- Section 8.1: Accessibility Specifications (Screen reader announcements)

## Task Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Loading States
- [ ] **Skeleton Loading Components**:
  - Create `src/components/ui/SkeletonLoader.tsx` for form fields
  - Create card skeleton with proper dimensions matching real cards
  - Implement pulse animation using `animate-pulse` class
- [ ] **Progressive Loading**:
  - Show skeleton during initial page load
  - Smooth transition from skeleton to real content
  - Maintain layout stability during loading

### 2. Comprehensive Error States
- [ ] **Form Field Errors**:
  - Implement error styling with `inputError` classes
  - Show inline validation errors with `errorText` classes
  - Clear error states when user corrects input
- [ ] **API Error Display**:
  - Connection timeout errors with retry buttons
  - Server error messages with actionable suggestions
  - Network offline detection and messaging

### 3. Empty States Implementation
- [ ] **No Models Available**:
  - Display "No models found at this endpoint" message
  - Include troubleshooting suggestions
  - Provide retry action button
- [ ] **Connection Failed States**:
  - Clear error messages for different failure types
  - Visual indicators using appropriate icons
  - Actionable retry mechanisms

### 4. Toast Notification System Enhancement
- [ ] **Toast Queue Management**:
  - Maximum 3 toasts visible simultaneously
  - Automatic stacking with proper spacing
  - Dismiss older toasts when queue is full
- [ ] **Toast Content Variations**:
  - Success toasts with checkmark icons
  - Error toasts with X circle icons
  - Warning toasts with triangle icons
  - Loading toasts with spinner icons

### 5. Connection Status Indicators
- [ ] **Real-time Status Updates**:
  - Green checkmark for successful connections
  - Red X for failed connections
  - Animated spinner for testing in progress
  - Orange warning for timeout states
- [ ] **Status Messages**:
  - "Connected" with success styling
  - "Testing..." with loading animation
  - "Connection Failed" with error styling
  - "Still trying to connect..." after 8 seconds

### 6. Form Validation Polish
- [ ] **Real-time Validation Feedback**:
  - 400ms debounced validation after typing stops
  - Immediate validation on blur events
  - Clear validation errors when field becomes valid
- [ ] **Validation Summary**:
  - Count total validation errors
  - Display summary in global save bar
  - Disable save button when errors exist

### 7. Screen Reader Announcements
- [ ] **Status Change Announcements**:
  - "Connection successful. Model list has been updated."
  - "Configuration has been saved successfully."
  - "Error in {fieldName}: {errorMessage}"
- [ ] **Live Regions Implementation**:
  - Use `aria-live="polite"` for status updates
  - Use `aria-live="assertive"` for critical errors
  - Implement proper announcement timing

### 8. Error Recovery Mechanisms
- [ ] **Retry Functionality**:
  - Retry buttons for failed API calls
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
  - Clear retry count limits (max 3 attempts)
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Form remains functional with fallback defaults
  - Offline mode detection and messaging
  - Local storage backup for unsaved changes

### 9. Error and State Change Logging Implementation
- [ ] **Comprehensive Error and State Logging from Section 10.2**:
  - Log all error conditions with full context and stack traces
  - Log loading state transitions and durations for performance monitoring
  - Log user interactions that trigger error states or recovery actions
  - Log retry attempts and their outcomes for debugging
  - Include correlation IDs to track error flows across components
  - Log form validation errors and user correction patterns
  - Ensure error logs include actionable information for debugging
  - Log toast notification events and user dismissal patterns
  - Log connection status changes and timeout events
  - Log offline/online state transitions and user behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All loading states display with proper animations
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Toast notifications work correctly with proper stacking
- [ ] Connection status indicators update in real-time
- [ ] Form validation provides immediate feedback
- [ ] Screen readers announce all status changes
- [ ] Retry mechanisms work for all error scenarios
- [ ] Empty states provide helpful guidance
- [ ] Loading transitions are smooth and stable
- [ ] All error scenarios have appropriate recovery options

## Evidence of Completion
To mark this task complete, provide:
1. Screenshot/GIF of skeleton loading transitioning to real content
2. Screenshot showing all error states with proper styling
3. Screenshot of toast notification stacking (3+ toasts)
4. Video demonstration of connection status indicators updating
5. Screenshot showing form validation errors with clear messaging
6. Demonstration of screen reader announcements working
7. Screenshot showing retry mechanisms for failed operations
