# Task 8: Form Validation System Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive form validation system with real-time feedback, debounced validation, field-level error handling, and accessibility compliance for all configuration forms.

## Reference Specification Sections
- Section 5.3: Form Validation Specifications
- Section 8.1: Accessibility Specifications (Form validation)
- Section 6.2: UI States & Loading Behavior (Validation states)

## Task Requirements

### 1. Validation Framework Setup
- [ ] **Core Validation System**:
  - Create `src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts` with validation logic
  - Implement field-level validation with error state management
  - Create validation rule system with composable validators
  - Support async validation for API-dependent fields

### 2. Debounced Validation Implementation
- [ ] **Real-time Validation**:
  - 400ms debounced validation after typing stops
  - Immediate validation on blur events
  - Clear validation errors when field becomes valid
  - Prevent validation during user typing

### 3. Field-Level Error Display
- [ ] **Error UI Components**:
  - Create `ErrorMessage` component with proper styling
  - Implement field error state with red border and icon
  - Show validation errors below form fields
  - Support multiple error messages per field

### 4. Validation Rules Implementation
- [ ] **Provider Configuration Validation**:
  - Required field validation for Base URL and API Key
  - URL format validation with protocol checking
  - API Key format validation (length, characters)
  - Custom validation messages for each field type

### 5. Advanced Settings Validation
- [ ] **Numeric Field Validation**:
  - Temperature range validation (0.0-2.0)
  - Max Tokens positive integer validation
  - Top P range validation (0.0-1.0)
  - Presence Penalty range validation (-2.0-2.0)

### 6. Cross-Field Validation
- [ ] **Form-Level Validation**:
  - Validate model selection requires successful connection
  - Ensure embedding provider configuration consistency
  - Validate advanced settings only when provider is selected
  - Check for conflicting configuration values

### 7. Validation State Management
- [ ] **Form Validation State**:
  - Track validation state for each field
  - Implement form-level validation summary
  - Disable save button when validation errors exist
  - Show validation error count in global save bar

### 8. Accessibility Integration
- [ ] **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Use `aria-invalid="true"` for fields with errors
  - Link error messages with `aria-describedby`
  - Announce validation errors to screen readers
  - Implement live region for validation updates

### 9. Error Recovery and Guidance
- [ ] **User-Friendly Validation**:
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages
  - Include suggestions for fixing validation errors
  - Show validation success states (green checkmarks)
  - Guide users through fixing multiple errors

### 10. Validation Testing Integration
- [ ] **Test Coverage**:
  - Unit tests for all validation functions
  - Integration tests for form validation flows
  - Accessibility tests for validation announcements
  - Edge case testing for validation scenarios

### 11. Form Validation Logging Implementation
- [ ] **Comprehensive Validation Logging from Section 10.2**:
  - Log validation error patterns and user correction behaviors
  - Log validation performance metrics and debouncing effectiveness
  - Log form submission attempts with validation state
  - Log user interactions with validation error messages
  - Include correlation IDs to track validation workflows
  - Log accessibility compliance for validation features
  - Log validation rule effectiveness and false positives
  - Log cross-field validation triggers and results
  - Log validation state changes and timing patterns
  - Log error recovery success rates and user assistance needs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All form fields have appropriate validation rules
- [ ] Validation provides immediate feedback without blocking typing
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Validation integrates with form state management
- [ ] Save operations are blocked when validation errors exist
- [ ] Screen readers properly announce validation errors
- [ ] Validation performance meets 100ms response requirement
- [ ] All edge cases and error scenarios are handled
- [ ] Validation supports both synchronous and asynchronous rules
- [ ] Form validation integrates with global save bar state

## Evidence of Completion
To mark this task complete, provide:
1. Screenshot showing validation errors with proper styling
2. Video demonstration of debounced validation working
3. Screenshot of validation error count in global save bar
4. Screen reader testing showing validation announcements
5. Unit test coverage report for validation functions
6. Performance metrics showing sub-100ms validation response
7. Integration test results for all validation scenarios
