Master Product Requirements Document: AI Documentation Cache1. Executive SummaryProduct Vision: To create an intelligent, self-improving documentation cache that dramatically reduces developer search time and cognitive load. The system will learn from user queries to proactively source, curate, and rank authoritative documentation, providing instant, context-aware answers within the developer's workflow.Success Metrics:Performance: <1s response time for 95% of cached queries; <5s for queries requiring enrichment.Quality: Achieve a >90% result relevance score (based on user feedback) and a >80% cache hit rate after one week of typical usage for a specific technology stack.Adoption: Enable a complete, one-command setup that is fully functional in under 5 minutes on a standard developer machine.Development Timeline: The project is broken down into six, two-week sprints, for a total estimated timeline of 12 weeks for the initial version.2. Epic BreakdownThe project is organized into six epics, each corresponding to a development sprint and focusing on a distinct technical domain.Epic 1: Foundation (Sprint 1): Build the core HTTP API and data persistence layers.Epic 2: External Integrations (Sprint 2): Develop clients for all external services (AnythingLLM, LLM Providers, GitHub).Epic 3: Content Pipeline (Sprint 3): Implement the content acquisition and processing pipelines.Epic 4: Core Intelligence (Sprint 4): Implement the main search and enrichment orchestration logic.Epic 5: User Features (Sprint 5): Develop the feedback system and the administrative web UI.Epic 6: Operations (Sprint 6): Finalize deployment, packaging, and documentation.3.

Dependency & Risk AnalysisCritical Path: The critical path flows directly through the sprints: Foundation -> Integrations -> Content Pipeline -> Core Intelligence. A delay in any of these sprints will directly impact the project timeline.Key Dependencies:The entire system relies on a stable and performant AnythingLLM instance.The intelligence layer relies on a functional Ollama instance (or a configured cloud provider).Highest Risk: LLM Response Quality (Mitigation: PRD-005). The system's intelligence depends on the LLM's ability to reliably output structured JSON. The risk is mitigated by robust parsing logic, prompt engineering, and the ability to failover to different providers or rule-based systems.Second Highest Risk: Content Quality from Web Scraping (Mitigation: PRD-007, PRD-008). Scraped content can be noisy. This is mitigated by sophisticated content extraction selectors and the quality scoring heuristics in the processing pipeline.This completes the comprehensive PRD suite. The project is now fully specified and ready for implementation.
