Technology Stack and Compatibility AnalysisThis document outlines the complete technology stack for the AI Documentation Cache project, verifies the latest stable versions as of June 2025, and confirms their compatibility.I. Core Application & APITechnologySpecified VersionLatest Stable VersionCompatibility NotesPython3.11-slim3.13.0Action Required. The Dockerfile specifies 3.11-slim. While 3.11 is still supported, upgrading to Python 3.12+ is recommended for performance improvements. All listed Python libraries are compatible with Python 3.12 and 3.13. We will update the Dockerfile to use python:3.12-slim.FastAPINot specified0.111.0Fully compatible with Python 3.12+.

Frontend & UITechnologySpecified VersionLatest Stable VersionCompatibility NotesJinja2Not specified3.1.4Used by FastAPI for server-side template rendering. Fully compatible.Tailwind CSSNot specified3.4.4Loaded from a CDN, so it is independent of the backend stack. No compatibility issues.VI. Deployment & OperationsTechnologySpecified VersionLatest Stable VersionCompatibility NotesDockerNot specified27.0.3The Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml use standard, widely supported features. No issues.Docker Composev3.8v2.27.1 (plugin)The docker-compose.yml specifies file format version 3.8, which is modern and fully supported by current Docker Compose versions.Summary and RecommendationsThe technology stack is modern, robust, and well-supported. The components are highly compatible with each other.The only recommended action is to update the base Python version in the Dockerfile from 3.11-slim to 3.12-slim. This change takes advantage of performance and syntax improvements in a newer, stable version of Python while maintaining full compatibility with all specified libraries. All other specified versions are either the latest stable releases or are perfectly suitable for this project.I will now update the relevant PRD (PRD-013: Operations & Deployment) to reflect this change.
