# Context7 Background Job Framework - Implementation Summary

## üéâ SUCCESS - Background Job Framework Complete!

I have successfully created a comprehensive background job framework specifically for Context7 document TTL management and refresh operations.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Core Framework Components**

#### **Context7BackgroundJobManager** (`src/background_jobs/manager.py`)
- Main orchestrator for all background job operations
- Handles job lifecycle: registration, execution, monitoring
- Supports concurrent job execution with configurable limits
- Implements graceful startup and shutdown procedures
- Provides comprehensive error handling and recovery

#### **JobScheduler** (`src/background_jobs/scheduler.py`)  
- Flexible scheduling system supporting:
  - Cron expressions (e.g., "0 2 * * *" for daily at 2 AM)
  - Interval-based scheduling (seconds, minutes, hours, days)
  - One-time executions
- Intelligent next execution time calculation
- Schedule bounds and execution limits

#### **JobStorage** (`src/background_jobs/storage.py`)
- Persistent storage for job configurations and execution history
- Database schema with tables for:
  - `background_job_configs` - Job configuration storage
  - `background_job_executions` - Execution history and metrics
  - `background_job_metrics` - Aggregated performance metrics
- Cleanup of old execution records

#### **JobMonitor** (`src/background_jobs/monitoring.py`)
- Real-time health monitoring and alerting
- Performance metrics collection and export
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Alert generation for failures and performance issues
- Health status tracking per job and overall system

### 2. **Specialized Job Implementations**

#### **TTLCleanupJob** (`src/background_jobs/jobs.py`)
- **Purpose**: Daily cleanup of expired Context7 documents
- **Features**:
  - Batch processing across multiple workspaces
  - Integration with Weaviate's `cleanup_expired_documents`
  - Intelligent workspace filtering
  - Rate limiting to avoid service overload
  - Comprehensive PIPELINE_METRICS logging

#### **DocumentRefreshJob** (`src/background_jobs/jobs.py`)
- **Purpose**: Weekly refresh of near-expired Context7 documents
- **Features**:
  - Identifies documents approaching expiration
  - Quality-based refresh prioritization
  - Batch processing with configurable sizes
  - Integration with Context7IngestionService
  - TTL extension for refreshed documents

#### **HealthCheckJob** (`src/background_jobs/jobs.py`)
- **Purpose**: Regular health monitoring of Context7 services
- **Features**:
  - Checks Weaviate connectivity and health
  - Database connection verification
  - Context7 service availability monitoring
  - Workspace health assessment
  - Comprehensive health reporting

### 3. **Configuration Management**

#### **Comprehensive Configuration Models** (`src/background_jobs/models.py`)
```python
# Context7-specific configuration
Context7JobConfig(
    ttl_cleanup_batch_size=50,
    refresh_batch_size=20, 
    refresh_threshold_days=7,
    max_concurrent_workspace_jobs=3
)

# Overall manager configuration
BackgroundJobManagerConfig(
    enabled=True,
    max_concurrent_jobs=5,
    job_queue_size=100,
    scheduler_interval_seconds=60
)
```

#### **Default Job Configurations**
- **Daily TTL Cleanup**: Runs at 2 AM daily
- **Weekly Document Refresh**: Runs Sunday at 3 AM  
- **Health Checks**: Every 5 minutes
- All configurable via cron expressions or intervals

### 4. **Service Integration**

#### **BackgroundJobService** (`src/background_jobs/service.py`)
- High-level service wrapper for easy integration
- Lifecycle management (start/stop/restart)
- Configuration loading from environment variables
- Health status and metrics access
- Job management operations (enable/disable/execute)

#### **API Endpoints** (`src/api/v1/background_jobs_endpoints.py`)
- RESTful API for job management:
  - `GET /background-jobs/health` - System health
  - `GET /background-jobs/jobs` - List all jobs
  - `POST /background-jobs/jobs/{id}/execute` - Manual execution
  - `GET /background-jobs/stats/summary` - Statistics
- Full FastAPI integration ready

### 5. **Advanced Features**

#### **Error Handling & Retry Logic**
```python
RetryConfig(
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay_seconds=60,
    retry_backoff_multiplier=2.0,
    retry_on_errors=["ConnectionError", "TimeoutError", "WeaviateError"]
)
```

#### **Comprehensive Logging**
- PIPELINE_METRICS format for structured logging
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Performance metrics (duration, throughput, error rates)
- Health status tracking

#### **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Real-time job health monitoring
- Performance degradation detection
- Consecutive failure alerting
- Resource usage monitoring
- Export to external monitoring systems

## üìä Key Metrics & Monitoring

### PIPELINE_METRICS Logging Examples
```
PIPELINE_METRICS: step=ttl_cleanup_job_start correlation_id=ttl_cleanup_abc123 job_id=daily-ttl-cleanup
PIPELINE_METRICS: step=ttl_cleanup_workspace_complete correlation_id=ttl_cleanup_abc123 workspace=test-workspace duration_ms=1500 deleted_documents=10
PIPELINE_METRICS: step=document_refresh_job_complete correlation_id=doc_refresh_def456 duration_ms=5000 total_refreshed=25 success_rate=96.0%
```

### Health Monitoring
- Job-level health status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
