# Operations & Deployment Scaffolding (PRD-013)

This directory contains the foundational scaffolding for production deployment, operations, and maintenance of the AI Documentation Cache System.

## Structure

- [`docker/`](./docker): Dockerfiles, Compose, and service configs
- [`ci/`](./ci): CI/CD pipeline templates and scripts
- [`monitoring/`](./monitoring): Monitoring, logging, and alerting configs
- [`secrets/`](./secrets): Secrets management templates (never commit real secrets)
- [`env/`](./env): Environment variable templates for all services
- [`scripts/`](./scripts): Operational scripts (backup, restore, health checks, etc.)
- [`docs/`](./docs): Operational procedures and runbooks

## Implementation TODOs

- Complete all TODOs in config and script files
- Integrate with all PRD-001 to PRD-012 components
- Validate all configs in staging before production
