# Bulk Expiration Query Methods - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Weaviate client now has comprehensive bulk expiration query methods implemented and working correctly. All methods have been enhanced with improved error handling, logging, performance optimizations, and detailed statistics.

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA MET

### 1. Bulk Expiration Query Method Exists and Works
- âœ… `get_expired_documents()` method implemented
- âœ… Enhanced with custom limit parameter (default: 10000)
- âœ… Proper TTL filtering using `expires_at <= current_time`
- âœ… Returns documents with all required metadata

### 2. Expired Document Cleanup Method Exists and Works
- âœ… `cleanup_expired_documents()` method implemented  
- âœ… Enhanced with batch processing (default batch size: 50)
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- âœ… Returns detailed statistics including duration and success/failure counts

### 3. Methods Handle Large Datasets Efficiently
- âœ… Configurable limits to prevent memory issues
- âœ… Batch processing for cleanup operations
- âœ… Optimized query method with fallback (`get_expired_documents_optimized()`)
- âœ… Safe pagination limits (tested with limits up to 10000)

### 4. Proper Error Handling and Logging Implemented
- âœ… Comprehensive try-catch blocks in all methods
- âœ… Detailed logging with workspace context
- âœ… Graceful degradation when native filtering not available
- âœ… Custom WeaviateError exceptions with context

### 5. Query Filters Work Correctly with TTL Fields
- âœ… Datetime comparison filtering working correctly
- âœ… Handles missing or invalid TTL fields gracefully
- âœ… Groups chunks by document for proper document-level expiration
- âœ… Supports multiple TTL fields (expires_at, created_at, updated_at)

## ðŸš€ ENHANCED FEATURES ADDED

### Additional Methods Implemented

1. **`get_expired_documents_optimized()`**
   - Attempts to use Weaviate's native filtering when available
   - Falls back to Python filtering when native filtering not supported
   - Provides better performance for large datasets

2. **`get_expiration_statistics()`**
   - Comprehensive workspace expiration analysis
   - Statistics by provider, expiration status, and time ranges
   - Percentage calculations for expired vs active documents
   - Identifies documents expiring soon (within 7 days)

3. **Enhanced `get_documents_by_provider()`**
   - Added custom limit parameter
   - Improved logging and error handling
   - Better performance monitoring

### API Endpoints Added/Enhanced

All methods are exposed through REST API endpoints:

1. **GET** `/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/{workspace_slug}/expired`
   - Query parameters: `limit` (default: 10000)
   - Returns expired documents with metadata

2. **GET** `/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/{workspace_slug}/expired/optimized`
   - Query parameters: `limit` (default: 10000)  
   - Uses optimized querying when available

3. **DELETE** `/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/{workspace_slug}/expired`
   - Query parameters: `batch_size` (default: 50)
   - Performs bulk cleanup with detailed results

4. **GET** `/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/{workspace_slug}/providers/{provider}`
   - Query parameters: `limit` (default: 10000)
   - Returns documents from specific source provider

5. **GET** `/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/{workspace_slug}/expiration/statistics`
   - Returns comprehensive expiration statistics

## ðŸ§ª TESTING COMPLETED

### Functional Testing
- âœ… All methods exist and are callable
- âœ… API endpoints respond correctly
- âœ… Empty workspace queries return expected results
- âœ… Error handling works for invalid workspaces
- âœ… Batch processing works for cleanup operations

### Performance Testing
- âœ… Methods complete within reasonable time limits
- âœ… Large limit parameters handled safely
- âœ… Memory usage controlled with pagination
- âœ… Concurrent operations supported

### API Testing
- âœ… All endpoints return valid JSON responses
- âœ… Query parameters work correctly
- âœ… HTTP status codes appropriate for success/failure
- âœ… Error messages are informative

## ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Key Enhancements Made

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Configurable query limits to prevent timeout errors
   - Batch processing for large cleanup operations  
   - Efficient document grouping from chunk-level data

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Comprehensive exception handling with context
   - Graceful degradation when features not available
   - Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

3. **Logging Enhancements**
   - Operation progress tracking
   - Performance metrics (duration, counts)
   - Contextual information (workspace, provider, etc.)

4. **Statistics and Reporting**
   - Document counts by expiration status
   - Provider-based breakdowns
   - Time-based analysis (expired, expiring soon, long-term)

## ðŸŽ¯ USAGE EXAMPLES

### Python Client Usage
```python
async with WeaviateVectorClient(config) as client:
    # Get expired documents
    expired = await client.get_expired_documents('workspace-name')
    
    # Cleanup with custom batch size
    result = await client.cleanup_expired_documents('workspace-name', batch_size=25)
    
    # Get statistics
    stats = await client.get_expiration_statistics('workspace-name')
    
    # Provider-specific query
    docs = await client.get_documents_by_provider('workspace-name', 'github')
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Get expired documents
curl "http://localhost:4080/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/my-workspace/expired?limit=1000"

# Cleanup expired documents  
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:4080/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/my-workspace/expired?batch_size=25"

# Get expiration statistics
curl "http://localhost:4080/api/v1/weaviate/workspaces/my-workspace/expiration/statistics"
```

## âœ… CONCLUSION

The bulk expiration query methods have been successfully implemented and enhanced beyond the original requirements. All methods are working correctly, handle large datasets efficiently, include comprehensive error handling and logging, and support the TTL filtering requirements.

The implementation is production-ready and provides the foundation for automated document lifecycle management in the DocAIche system.
