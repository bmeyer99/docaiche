# Web UI Service

This service provides the backend for the configuration web UI.

## Architecture

The service is composed of the following components:

- **API Gateway**: A dedicated API gateway that exposes a tailored set of endpoints for the web UI. This gateway will handle request validation, authentication, and routing to the appropriate backend services.
- **Data Service**: A service responsible for fetching and aggregating data from various sources, including the database, cache, and other microservices. This service will provide a unified data access layer for the UI.
- **View Model Service**: A service that transforms data from the Data Service into view models that are optimized for rendering in the UI. This service will handle all presentation logic, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Real-time Service**: A WebSocket-based service that pushes real-time updates to the UI, such as health status changes and new query notifications.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Scaffolding**: Create the directory structure and initial files for the new service.
2.  **API Gateway**: Implement the API gateway with endpoints for health, stats, config, and content management.
3.  **Data Service**: Implement the data service to fetch data from the database and other services.
4.  **View Model Service**: Implement the view model service to transform data for the UI.
5.  **Real-time Service**: Implement the real-time service using WebSockets.
6.  **Integration**: Integrate the new service with the existing application and update the UI to use the new endpoints.
