### 3. Desktop Validation
- [ ] **Desktop (1024px+)**:
  - Test full horizontal tab layout
  - Verify optimal form layouts and spacing
  - Test hover states and interactions
  - Validate maximum width constraints

### 4. Touch Interface Optimization
- [ ] **Touch Target Requirements**:
  - Minimum 44px x 44px for all interactive elements
  - 8px minimum spacing between adjacent touch targets
  - Test tap accuracy on form controls
  - Validate touch feedback (active states)

### 5. Mobile Navigation Testing
- [ ] **Mobile Tab Navigation**:
  - Test dropdown select for primary tabs
  - Verify tab content updates correctly
  - Test mobile secondary tab navigation
  - Validate tab state persistence

### 6. Form Layout Responsive Testing
- [ ] **Form Adaptations**:
  - Test single-column layout on mobile
  - Verify two-column layout on tablet/desktop
  - Test form field sizing and spacing
  - Validate label and input alignment

### 7. Global Save Bar Mobile Testing
- [ ] **Mobile Save Bar**:
  - Test save bar visibility and positioning
  - Verify button stacking on very small screens
  - Test slide-up animation on mobile
  - Validate touch interactions

### 8. Content Prioritization
- [ ] **Mobile Content Strategy**:
  - Test critical content visibility
  - Verify secondary information accessibility
  - Test content scrolling behavior
  - Validate information hierarchy

### 9. Performance Testing Across Devices
- [ ] **Device Performance**:
  - Test loading times on mobile devices
  - Verify animation performance on lower-end devices
  - Test memory usage during interactions
  - Validate battery impact on mobile

### 10. Orientation Testing
- [ ] **Portrait and Landscape**:
  - Test tablet portrait mode layout
  - Verify tablet landscape mode functionality
  - Test mobile orientation changes
  - Validate layout stability during rotation

### 11. Text Scaling Testing
- [ ] **Accessibility Scaling**:
  - Test 200% text scaling without horizontal scroll
  - Verify layout integrity with large text
  - Test button and form field scaling
  - Validate content readability

### 12. Cross-Device Testing Matrix
- [ ] **Device Testing**:
  - iPhone (various models and iOS versions)
  - Android phones (Samsung, Google Pixel)
  - iPad (various sizes and orientations)
  - Android tablets
  - Desktop browsers at various resolutions

## Acceptance Criteria
