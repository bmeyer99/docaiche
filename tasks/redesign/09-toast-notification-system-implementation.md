# Task 9: Toast Notification System Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive toast notification system with positioning, stacking, auto-dismiss, accessibility support, and integration with all system operations.

## Reference Specification Sections
- Section 5.4: Toast Notification Implementation
- Section 8.1: Accessibility Specifications (Live regions)
- Section 6.2: UI States & Loading Behavior (Notification states)

## Task Requirements

### 1. Toast Component System
- [ ] **Core Toast Components**:
  - Create `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` with base toast component
  - Implement `ToastContainer` for positioning and stacking management
  - Create `ToastProvider` context for global toast state
  - Support success, error, warning, and info toast types

### 2. Toast Positioning and Layout
- [ ] **Positioning System**:
  - Fixed positioning at top-right of viewport
  - 24px margin from top and right edges
  - Stack toasts vertically with 12px spacing between
  - Ensure toasts stay above all other content (z-index: 9999)

### 3. Toast Stacking and Queue Management
- [ ] **Queue Management**:
  - Maximum 3 toasts visible simultaneously
  - Automatic stacking with proper spacing
  - Dismiss older toasts when queue is full
  - FIFO (first in, first out) queue behavior

### 4. Auto-Dismiss and Timing
- [ ] **Timing Controls**:
  - Success toasts: 4 seconds auto-dismiss
  - Error toasts: 8 seconds auto-dismiss (longer for reading)
  - Warning toasts: 6 seconds auto-dismiss
  - Info toasts: 5 seconds auto-dismiss
  - Pause auto-dismiss on hover

### 5. Toast Content and Styling
- [ ] **Visual Design**:
  - Icon integration (checkmark, X, warning triangle, info circle)
  - Color-coded background and border per toast type
  - Typography using design system specifications
  - Close button (X) for manual dismissal

### 6. Animation and Transitions
- [ ] **Entry/Exit Animations**:
  - Slide-in animation from right side (300ms ease-out)
  - Fade-out animation on dismiss (200ms ease-in)
  - Smooth stacking animations when toasts are added/removed
  - Height transition animations for smooth queue management

### 7. Accessibility Implementation
- [ ] **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Use `aria-live="polite"` for success/info toasts
  - Use `aria-live="assertive"` for error/warning toasts
  - Proper role attributes (`role="alert"` for errors)
  - Keyboard navigation support (focus management)

### 8. Toast Trigger Integration
- [ ] **System Integration**:
  - Save operation success/failure notifications
  - Connection test result notifications
  - Form validation error notifications
  - API error notifications with actionable messages

### 9. Toast API and Hooks
- [ ] **Developer Interface**:
  - Create `useToast()` hook for easy toast triggering
  - Support for custom toast messages and durations
  - Toast dismissal methods (dismiss all, dismiss by ID)
  - Toast update methods for progress notifications

### 10. Responsive Behavior
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**:
  - Adjust positioning for mobile viewports
  - Ensure touch-friendly close buttons (44px minimum)
  - Optimize toast width for mobile screens
  - Handle orientation changes gracefully

### 11. Toast Notification Logging Implementation
- [ ] **Comprehensive Toast Logging from Section 10.2**:
  - Log toast display events with content and type classification
  - Log user interaction with toasts (dismiss, hover, click actions)
  - Log toast queue management and overflow scenarios
  - Log accessibility compliance for toast announcements
  - Include correlation IDs to track notification workflows
  - Log toast performance metrics and animation timing
  - Log mobile-specific toast behavior and responsive adaptations
  - Log toast effectiveness and user response patterns
  - Log auto-dismiss timing and user manual dismissal rates
  - Log toast integration with system operations and error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All toast types display with correct styling and icons
- [ ] Toast stacking works correctly with maximum 3 visible
- [ ] Auto-dismiss timing works as specified for each toast type
- [ ] Entry and exit animations are smooth and performant
- [ ] Screen readers properly announce toast notifications
- [ ] Toast system integrates with all major user operations
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior works on all device sizes
- [ ] Toast queue management handles overflow scenarios
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and focus management works correctly
- [ ] Toast content supports rich formatting when needed

## Evidence of Completion
To mark this task complete, provide:
1. Screenshot showing all 4 toast types with proper styling
2. Video demonstration of toast stacking (3+ toasts)
3. Screen recording of accessibility announcements working
4. Video showing smooth entry/exit animations
5. Mobile device testing showing responsive behavior
6. Integration testing with save operations and API calls
7. Performance metrics showing animation frame rates

## Dependencies
- Task 8: Form Validation System Implementation

## Next Task
After completion, proceed to Task 10: Advanced Settings Toggle Implementation
