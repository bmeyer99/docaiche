## Critical Dependencies

### No Task Should Be Blocked
- Each task only depends on previously completed tasks
- No circular dependencies exist
- Clear handoff points between tasks

### Focus Areas Maintained
- **Tasks 1-3**: Infrastructure and design system
- **Tasks 4-5**: Navigation structure
- **Tasks 6-10**: Form components and interactions
- **Tasks 11-12**: API and data integration
- **Tasks 13-16**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Tasks 17-18**: Final validation and handoff

## Completion Tracking

To track completion, each task requires specific evidence:
- Screenshots/videos of functionality
- Code snippets demonstrating implementation
- Test results and validation reports
- Documentation of any issues and resolutions

## Success Criteria

The redesign is complete when:
- ✅ All 18 tasks are completed with evidence provided
- ✅ All Definition of Done criteria from the specification are met
- ✅ Frontend Developer has complete handoff package
- ✅ QA team has comprehensive testing procedures
- ✅ Product Owner has clear acceptance criteria

## Notes for Implementation

- **Task Duration**: Each task represents approximately 1-3 days of focused development work
- **Dependencies**: Must complete tasks in order; no skipping ahead
- **Evidence**: Each task must be validated before proceeding to next
- **Quality Gates**: Tasks 13-16 serve as comprehensive quality validation
- **Handoff Ready**: Task 18 completion means the project is ready for frontend development

## Getting Started

**Next Step**: Begin with Task 01: Foundation Setup & Project Configuration

Ensure you have:
- Access to the complete CONFIGURATION_PAGE_REDESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md
- Development environment set up
- Clear understanding of the Definition of Done criteria
- Agreement on evidence requirements for task completion
