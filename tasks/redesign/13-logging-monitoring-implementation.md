# Task 13: Logging & Monitoring Implementation

## Overview
Implement the comprehensive logging and monitoring system as specified in Section 10.2, providing production-ready observability, debugging capabilities, and performance analytics for the configuration interface.

## Reference Specification Sections
- Section 10.2: Logging Implementation (Complete logging specifications)
- Section 9.1: Development Constraints (Performance monitoring)
- Section 9.2: Testing Requirements (Monitoring validation)

## Task Requirements

### 1. Logging Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] **Core Logging System**:
  - Create `src/logging/logger.ts` with structured logging implementation
  - Implement log levels (error, warn, info, debug) with proper filtering
  - Create correlation ID system for tracking workflows
  - Support for contextual logging with metadata

### 2. User Interaction Logging
- [ ] **User Behavior Analytics**:
  - Log all user interactions (clicks, form changes, navigation)
  - Track user journey flows and completion rates
  - Log form field focus/blur events and input patterns
  - Record user preference changes and setting modifications

### 3. Form State and Validation Logging
- [ ] **Form Analytics**:
  - Log form state changes and dirty detection events
  - Track validation error patterns and user correction behaviors
  - Record form submission attempts and success/failure rates
  - Log user interactions with error messages and help text

### 4. API and Performance Logging
- [ ] **System Performance Monitoring**:
  - Log all API requests with response times and status codes
  - Track connection test results and failure patterns
  - Monitor component render performance and timing
  - Record loading state transitions and durations

### 5. Error and Exception Logging
- [ ] **Comprehensive Error Tracking**:
  - Log all JavaScript errors with stack traces and context
  - Track network failures and timeout scenarios
  - Record validation errors and recovery actions
  - Log component error boundaries and fallback activations

### 6. Accessibility and Responsive Logging
- [ ] **UX Quality Monitoring**:
  - Log screen reader interactions and announcement events
  - Track keyboard navigation patterns and focus management
  - Monitor responsive breakpoint transitions and mobile interactions
  - Log accessibility compliance validation results

### 7. Browser and Cross-Platform Logging
- [ ] **Compatibility Monitoring**:
  - Log browser-specific issues and workarounds applied
  - Track cross-browser performance differences
  - Monitor feature support and fallback usage
  - Record mobile device interactions and touch events

### 8. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] **Live Monitoring Interface**:
  - Create development monitoring dashboard for real-time logs
  - Implement log filtering and search capabilities
  - Display performance metrics and error rates
  - Show user behavior analytics and flow completion

### 9. Production Logging Strategy
- [ ] **Production-Ready Logging**:
  - Implement log aggregation and storage strategy
  - Configure log retention and cleanup policies
  - Setup alerting for critical errors and performance issues
  - Implement privacy-compliant logging (no sensitive data)

### 10. Integration Testing Logging
- [ ] **Test Coverage Monitoring**:
  - Log integration test results and coverage metrics
  - Track user flow validation and completion rates
  - Monitor automated test performance and reliability
  - Record manual testing results and QA validation

### 11. Log Data Security and Privacy
- [ ] **Secure Logging Implementation**:
  - Ensure no sensitive data (API keys, passwords) in logs
  - Implement log data encryption for sensitive environments
  - Create data retention policies compliant with privacy requirements
  - Support for log data anonymization and user privacy

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All logging categories from Section 10.2 are implemented
- [ ] Correlation IDs track workflows across components correctly
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides actionable insights
- [ ] Error logging includes sufficient context for debugging
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard is functional and useful
- [ ] Production logging strategy is privacy-compliant and secure
- [ ] Log filtering and search capabilities work effectively
- [ ] Integration with existing form state and API systems works
- [ ] Log data provides meaningful analytics for improvement
- [ ] System performance impact of logging is minimal

## Evidence of Completion
To mark this task complete, provide:
1. Screenshot of real-time monitoring dashboard with live logs
2. Log output samples showing structured logging with correlation IDs
3. Performance metrics showing minimal logging overhead
4. Privacy audit results confirming no sensitive data in logs
5. Integration test results showing logging captures all specified events
6. Documentation of log aggregation and retention strategy
7. Error scenario testing showing comprehensive error logging

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Foundation Setup & Project Configuration
- Task 8: Form Validation System Implementation
- Task 11: API Integration & Connection Testing

## Next Task
After completion, proceed to Task 14: Loading States & Error Handling Polish
