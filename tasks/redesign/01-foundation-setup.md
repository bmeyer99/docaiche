# Task 01: Foundation Setup & Project Configuration

## Overview
Set up the foundational structure for the Configuration Page Redesign, including project dependencies, TypeScript configuration, and basic folder structure.

## Reference Specification Sections
- Section 3.2: Data Models (TypeScript Interfaces)
- Section 4.1: Code Organization
- Section 5.1: Tailwind Configuration
- Section 9.1: Development Constraints

## Task Requirements

### 1. Project Dependencies
- [ ] Install and configure required dependencies:
  - React 18+ with TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS v3.x
  - Lucide React (for icons)
  - React Testing Library and Jest
  - ESLint with React and TypeScript rules
  - Prettier with consistent configuration

### 2. Tailwind Configuration
- [ ] Implement the complete Tailwind config from Section 5.1:
  - Custom color palette (primary, neutral, surface, border, text, status colors)
  - Inter font family configuration
  - Extended theme configuration

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
- [ ] Set up TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- [ ] Configure path aliases for clean imports
- [ ] Ensure no 'any' types policy

### 4. Folder Structure
- [ ] Create the complete folder structure from Section 4.1:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── configuration/
│   └── ui/
├── hooks/
├── types/
└── [additional folders as needed]
```

### 5. Type Definitions Setup
- [ ] Create `src/types/configuration.ts` with all interfaces from Section 3.2:
  - `ModelSettings`
  - `ProviderConfig`
  - `EmbeddingProviderConfig`
  - `SystemConfiguration`
  - `TestConnectionRequest`
  - `TestConnectionResponse`

### 6. Logging Utility Setup
- [ ] Implement logging utility with proper levels and categories from Section 10.1:
  - Error, warn, info, debug levels
  - Categories: api, user, state, validation, performance, error
  - Structured JSON logging for production
  - Human-readable format for development
  - Sensitive data redaction capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All dependencies installed and configured
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Tailwind CSS generates correctly with custom configuration
- [ ] Folder structure matches specification exactly
- [ ] All TypeScript interfaces are properly defined and exportable
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configurations are working
- [ ] Build process runs successfully
- [ ] Logging utility properly configured with all levels and categories
- [ ] Sensitive data redaction working correctly

## Evidence of Completion
To mark this task complete, provide:
1. Screenshot of successful `npm run build` or equivalent
2. Screenshot of TypeScript compilation with no errors
3. Code snippet showing successful import of all configuration types
4. Screenshot of Tailwind CSS custom colors working in a simple test component
5. File tree showing all required folders and files created

## Dependencies
- None (This is the foundation task)

## Next Task
After completion, proceed to Task 02: Design System Implementation
