## Technical Implementation Verification

### TTL Calculation Algorithm
The verification confirmed the TTL calculation formula works correctly:

```
final_ttl = min(max(
    base_ttl × tech_multiplier × doc_type_multiplier × content_multiplier × version_multiplier × quality_multiplier,
    min_days
), max_days)
```

**Example calculations verified**:
- React Guide: 30 × 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 67 days ✅
- TypeScript API: 30 × 2.0 × 2.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 120 → 90 days (capped) ✅
- Bootstrap News: 30 × 0.8 × 0.3 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 7 days ✅

### Metadata Processing Pipeline
The verification confirmed the metadata processing pipeline:

1. **SearchResult → Context7Document conversion** ✅
2. **Technology extraction**: metadata → intent fallback ✅
3. **Owner extraction**: metadata → "unknown" fallback ✅
4. **Version detection**: regex patterns for various formats ✅
5. **Document classification**: title/content analysis ✅
6. **Quality assessment**: code, links, headers, completeness ✅

### Batch Processing Architecture
The verification confirmed the batch processing design:

1. **Batch size management**: 5 documents per batch ✅
2. **Parallel processing**: asyncio.gather for concurrent execution ✅
3. **Error isolation**: individual document failures don't affect batch ✅
4. **TTL metadata**: proper timestamp calculations and database updates ✅
