## ADR Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR when making decisions that:
- **Affect the architecture** of the system
- **Impact multiple teams** or components
- **Have long-term consequences** for the project
- **Involve significant trade-offs** between alternatives
- **Establish patterns** that others should follow
- **Address security or compliance** requirements

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Initial ADR created with status "Proposed"
2. **Review**: Team reviews and provides feedback
3. **Decision**: ADR updated with final decision and status "Accepted"
4. **Implementation**: Decision is implemented according to plan
5. **Review**: Periodic review to assess decision outcomes
6. **Update**: If needed, create new ADR that "Supersedes" this one

### ADR Numbering
- Use sequential numbering: ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.
- Numbers are never reused, even for deprecated ADRs
- Maintain an index of all ADRs with status and brief description

### Quality Checklist
Before finalizing an ADR, ensure:
- [ ] Problem is clearly defined and understood
- [ ] Multiple options were considered with pros/cons
- [ ] Decision rationale is clearly explained
- [ ] Implementation plan is realistic and detailed
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Technical details are sufficient for implementation
- [ ] All stakeholders have had opportunity to provide input

### ADR Review Process
1. **Technical Review**: Architecture team reviews technical aspects
2. **Security Review**: Security team reviews security implications
3. **Business Review**: Product team reviews business impact
4. **Final Approval**: Technical lead or architect gives final approval

### Tools and Storage
- **Format**: Markdown files stored in version control
- **Location**: `/docs/architecture/decisions/` directory
- **Naming**: `ADR-XXXX-short-title.md`
- **Index**: Maintain `README.md` with list of all ADRs

### Example ADR Index
```markdown
