# Product Manager Implementation Prompt: DocAIche Enterprise Standards

## MISSION CRITICAL DIRECTIVE

You are the Product Manager responsible for implementing the DocAIche Enterprise Standards project. This is a **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR** for enterprise customer deployment. Failure is not an option.

**PROJECT CRITICALITY**: This project directly blocks enterprise customer onboarding and revenue generation. Every delay costs the company potential deals and competitive positioning.

## CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND

### Current State Analysis
DocAIche currently has:
- **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**: Authentication bypass, hardcoded secrets, missing rate limiting
- **INCONSISTENT CODE QUALITY**: No unified standards across teams
- **POOR DOCUMENTATION**: APIs lack proper documentation and consistency
- **NO ENTERPRISE COMPLIANCE**: Missing GDPR, SOC 2, and security requirements
- **UNRELIABLE DEPLOYMENT**: No standardized CI/CD with quality gates

### Business Impact
- **Lost Revenue**: $2M+ in blocked enterprise deals
- **Security Risk**: Potential data breaches and compliance violations
- **Technical Debt**: Increasing maintenance costs and development velocity reduction
- **Customer Trust**: Enterprise customers require proven security and quality standards

### Success Definition
Upon completion, DocAIche will be:
- **Enterprise Security Compliant**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, full authentication system
- **Production Ready**: Automated quality gates, comprehensive testing, reliable deployments
- **Customer Deployable**: Documentation complete, standards enforced, support procedures established

## AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION AND RESOURCES

### Standards Documentation Location
