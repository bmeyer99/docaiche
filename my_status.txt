The form now successfully says that it saves but the health check does not turn to Connected and when I reload the page it reverts everything back to defaults. I need you to systematically walk through the API endpoint "/api/v1/config/bulk" because we were able to get everything to work through that pipeline and get a 202 response. However we need to track where it actually goes. It is supposed to be saved in the configuration db I think, but I'm not positive so we need to check that also.
