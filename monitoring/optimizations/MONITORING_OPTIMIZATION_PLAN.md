# Comprehensive Monitoring Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive optimization strategy for the DocAIche monitoring stack, focusing on VictoriaMetrics as the primary time-series database, with optimizations for data partitioning, query performance, automated maintenance, and backup strategies.

## 1. Time-Series Data Partitioning Strategies

### 1.1 VictoriaMetrics Partitioning Configuration

VictoriaMetrics automatically partitions data by time, but we can optimize this through configuration:

#### Key Partitioning Parameters:
- **Retention Period**: 12 months (configurable)
- **Partition Size**: Monthly partitions for optimal query performance
- **Deduplication**: Enabled for 30s scrape intervals
- **Downsampling**: Automatic for historical data

#### Implementation:
See `victoriametrics-optimized.yml` for the complete configuration.

### 1.2 Data Tiering Strategy

| Time Range | Resolution | Storage Type | Use Case |
|------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| 0-7 days | Raw (30s) | SSD/Fast | Real-time monitoring |
| 7-30 days | 1-minute avg | SSD/Fast | Recent analysis |
| 30-90 days | 5-minute avg | HDD/Standard | Historical trends |
| 90-365 days | 15-minute avg | HDD/Cold | Long-term analysis |

## 2. Automated Maintenance Procedures

### 2.1 Daily Maintenance Tasks
- Compact recent partitions
- Update statistics
- Clean up temporary files
- Verify data integrity

### 2.2 Weekly Maintenance Tasks
- Optimize older partitions
- Rebuild indexes for frequently queried metrics
- Archive old query logs
- Update cardinality statistics

### 2.3 Monthly Maintenance Tasks
- Full backup of critical data
- Partition rotation and archival
- Performance baseline updates
- Storage capacity planning

See `maintenance-scheduler.sh` for the automated maintenance implementation.

## 3. Query Performance Monitoring

### 3.1 Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Query Performance Metrics:
- Query duration percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
- Query rate and throughput
- Cache hit ratio
- Resource utilization per query

#### Storage Metrics:
- Ingestion rate
- Active series count
- Storage space utilization
- Compaction duration

### 3.2 Performance Dashboards

Three specialized Grafana dashboards are provided:
1. **Query Performance Dashboard** - Real-time query analytics
2. **Storage Optimization Dashboard** - Storage and compaction metrics
3. **System Health Dashboard** - Overall monitoring stack health

See the `grafana-dashboards/` directory for dashboard JSON files.

### 3.3 Query Optimization Rules

Recording rules are implemented to pre-calculate expensive queries:
- Hourly aggregations for high-cardinality metrics
- Daily rollups for trending data
- Service-level aggregations

See `recording-rules.yml` for the complete rule set.

## 4. Backup Strategies

### 4.1 Backup Tiers

| Tier | Frequency | Retention | Method |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Hot | Every 6h | 48 hours | Snapshot |
| Daily | Daily | 7 days | Incremental |
| Weekly | Weekly | 4 weeks | Full |
| Monthly | Monthly | 12 months | Full + Archive |

### 4.2 Backup Implementation

The backup strategy includes:
- **Automated snapshots** using VictoriaMetrics native backup
- **Incremental backups** for efficient storage
- **Offsite replication** for disaster recovery
- **Automated verification** of backup integrity

See `backup-strategy.sh` for the implementation.

### 4.3 Recovery Procedures

1. **Point-in-time recovery** from snapshots
2. **Selective metric restoration** 
3. **Full system recovery** procedures
4. **Recovery time objectives (RTO)**: < 1 hour

## 5. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Deploy optimized VictoriaMetrics configuration
- Set up automated maintenance scripts
- Configure backup infrastructure

### Phase 2: Monitoring (Week 2)
- Deploy performance monitoring dashboards
- Configure alerting rules
- Establish baseline metrics

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3-4)
- Implement recording rules
- Fine-tune query performance
- Optimize storage utilization

### Phase 4: Validation (Week 5)
- Load testing
- Recovery drills
- Performance benchmarking

## 6. Resource Requirements

### Storage Requirements:
- Primary storage: 500GB SSD for hot data
- Secondary storage: 2TB HDD for cold data
- Backup storage: 3TB for retention policy

### Compute Requirements:
- VictoriaMetrics: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM
- Maintenance jobs: 1 CPU core, 2GB RAM
- Backup processes: 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM

## 7. Monitoring and Alerting

### Critical Alerts:
- Query latency > 5s
- Storage utilization > 85%
- Backup failure
- Ingestion lag > 2 minutes

### Warning Alerts:
- Query latency > 2s
- Storage utilization > 70%
- High cardinality metrics
- Maintenance job delays

## 8. Best Practices

1. **Label Management**:
   - Limit cardinality through consistent labeling
   - Use recording rules for high-cardinality aggregations
   - Regular cardinality audits

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Use time-bounded queries
   - Leverage recording rules for repeated queries
   - Implement query result caching

3. **Storage Management**:
   - Regular compaction schedules
   - Automated old data cleanup
   - Monitoring of storage growth trends

4. **Operational Excellence**:
   - Documented runbooks for common issues
   - Automated health checks
   - Regular performance reviews

## 9. Cost Optimization

1. **Storage Tiering**: Move old data to cheaper storage
2. **Compression**: Enable maximum compression for cold data
3. **Retention Policies**: Implement data lifecycle management
4. **Resource Scaling**: Auto-scale based on actual usage

## 10. Security Considerations

1. **Backup Encryption**: All backups encrypted at rest
2. **Access Control**: Role-based access to metrics
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all configuration changes
4. **Network Security**: Encrypted transport for remote storage
